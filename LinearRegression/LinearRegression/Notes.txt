- VS 2015 - DotNet 4.6.1
- Extension: Newtonsoft.Json 10.0.3
- Source control: GitHub
- cmd: [path LinearRegression.exe] [from currency] [to currency]
Ex: LinearRegression.exe USD TRY
- Console: input FROM and TO currencies to calculate the predicted exchange rate

Questions:
1. How accurate is the predictor?
-> The predictor is not really accurate. Because it only uses 12 month-points for calculating, but exchange rates change every single day, single minute.
We cannot know that 12 points contain bad values (too big or too small) or not. They will effect to the reliability of its linear.

2. How could we make it more accurate?
-> a. Instead of using more month-points, we can compare among different regressions with week-points, day-points, etc
b. We need spend time to research/refer internet, books more about improvements of the linear regression. Then apply to the application later.
